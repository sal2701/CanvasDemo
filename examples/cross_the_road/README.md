This example can be treated as a simple game "Cross the Road!"

About the Game:

1. Player is represented by a black circle.
2. There are three parallel roads. Player has to cross all the three roads without getting hit by the vehicles(here,just rectangles)
3. The four arrow keys must be used to move around the screen.
4. If he gets hit by a vehicle or tries to escape out of the screen, the player is brought back to his initial position.
5. For now, we can continue playing even after the player crosses all three roads. There is no end for this game:)

Doesn't it feel good to actually make something to play,just with basic shapes and elementary math!
